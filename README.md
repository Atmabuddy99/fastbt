# fastbt


fastbt is a simple backtesting framework aimed at dirty checking of strategies for day trading.
It makes a lot of assumptions and is not a full fledged backtesting framework.
Its just a wrapped among popular libraries focused on oft repeated functions.
If you find some strategy works, then test it with a full fledged library such as zipline or backtrader.
If your strategy doesn't work, then most probably it won't work.

This is very much **alpha**
